# 🏥 AI-Powered Alzheimer’s Detection System 🧠  

### 🚀 TechFiesta 3rd Place Winning Project 🏆  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-driven diagnostic system** designed to assist doctors in **early detection, analysis, and monitoring of Alzheimer's Disease**. Using **deep learning, Grad-CAM analysis, and biomarker evaluation**, the system provides **detailed insights into brain scans**, helping medical professionals make informed decisions.  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ **Secure Doctor Authentication** – Login & manage patients securely.  
✅ **Patient Management** – Add, store, and manage patient records efficiently.  
✅ **MRI/CT Scan Upload** – AI-powered analysis of brain scans.  
✅ **AI-Powered Diagnosis** – Predict Alzheimer’s severity with deep learning models.  
✅ **Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)** – Visual heatmaps for better interpretability.  
✅ **Extensive Report Generation** – Includes prediction scores & biomarker analysis.  
✅ **Data Storage & Historical Analysis** – Monitor patient progression over time.  

## 🎯 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Doctor logs in** and accesses the patient management dashboard.  
2️⃣ **New patients are added**, and medical records are maintained.  
3️⃣ **Brain scans (MRI/CT) are uploaded** for AI-powered analysis.  
4️⃣ **AI model predicts** the likelihood of Alzheimer’s and highlights affected areas.  
5️⃣ **Detailed reports are generated**, including Grad-CAM heatmaps and biomarker insights.  
6️⃣ **Doctors store patient reports** and track disease progression over time.
